This fund was established in 2013 to address unexpected hardships faced by CFAD students that cannot be covered through traditional financial aid or scholarships. Funds can be accessed by students at any time during the academic year through a simple application process, making this the best method to support students facing an unforeseen financial crisis. Students may apply for funds no more than one time per semester. Amounts of awards will vary based on demonstrated need, and the number of awards granted each semester is subject to the availability of funds.
