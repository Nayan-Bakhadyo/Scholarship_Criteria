  "description": "Viola Straw became an LPN through OJT in the mid-late 1940s and was grandfathered into LPN licensure when Vocational Education became the requirement for LPN licensure. When her daughter chose to pursue nursing, Viola Straw insisted her daughter complete a BS program for licensure as an RN which she did in 1975 at Central State University. Both recognized the effort required to make education a priority for career in nursing. To this end, this scholarship is designed to assist those seeking a BS nursing education.
