  "description": "In the spirit of Diogenes, who was known for seeking the truth, this scholarship supports students to broaden their horizons through an immersive engagement with target cultures and countries through study abroad. The Diogenes award may fund group travel or individual projects, including but not limited to study tours, a semester (or year) abroad at one of UCOÂ’s partner institutions, or independent study (done for credit) which involves travel abroad for a minimum of two weeks, supervised by a UCO faculty member. Students participating in domestic study tours are not eligible. There is a preference for students doing independent study. This endowment is made possible by the generosity of Sara and John Turner, both lifelong learners filled with intellectual curiosity and committed to hard work and perseverance. They wanted to broaden the horizons for bright, self-motivated students and make it possible for them to see and explore the world, bringing a larger truth, in the spirit of Diogenes, back to Oklahoma. Eligibility requirements UCO students majoring in Liberal Arts- or in the research areas of Anthropology, Archaeology, Art History, Education, Classical Literature or History US Citizens with a preference, when possible, for Oklahoma residents A preference for students with a 3.0 GPA although students with a GPA above 2.75 may submit a written statement, detailing their commitment to their studies and will be considered based on demonstrated academic improvement A letter of reference and support by a UCO faculty member A letter of justification from the student, as part of the application, that speaks to their experience as a self-starter, their reasons for wanting an international experience and includes a tentative budget. The letter should also include a plan to share their experience with a wider audience. Digital counts but an in-person opportunity to speak to a group about the impact of the trip must be included. Upon completion, the student must provide, in writing, to their faculty advisor for the study tour a summary of the group to whom they shared their experience, e.g. a class, community group, etc., and a reflection on whether they believe they inspired any others to broaden their horizons.",
